Changes:

3.2	 Mon Sep 17 2001
		- Added Dynamic Font support - Now create a personal FONT file 
		  containing the fonts you wish to use as ".myefonts".  See example 
		  included with this distribution.  File-name overrideable with: 
		  -f=fontfile.
		- Added Print option to File menu for command to apply to selected 
		  text or entire file.  Last command is saved in file ".myeprint".
3.23	Fri Jan 11 2002
		- Added themes, (move myethemes to .myethemes, and edit to suit).
3.3	 Thu Mar 21 2002
		- Added "-font" option, if numeric - specifies font on lin# in .myefonts 
		  file; otherwise, specifies 1st word of a font name in .myefonts.
		- Added auto-backup capability based on a new file stored in the 
		  program's home directory called ".ebackups".  this file contains a 
		  single line with a number, ie. 10. specifying the number of backup 
		  files to save before overwriting existing ones in $HOME/tmp.  A 
		  backup file is created whenever a new file is opened and contains 
		  the contents of the just-opened file, and is named "e.##.tmp".
		- Fixed problems with ability to stop processes in "Perl.Run" option.
3.32 Tue Jul 2 2002
		- Added manual backup menu option.
		- Fixed Tk/MainLoop problem which caused cpu to be 100% utilized 
		  in 3.31 (my laptop's noisy fan was always coming on)!
3.42 Wed Jul 31 2002
		- Fixed Perl.Run option stuff I broke in v3.32.
		- Changed "/" to "\\" in several places when running under M$-Windows.
		- Now looks for ".ebackups" in user's home directory instead of the 
		  program's home directory (each user should have their own copy of 
		  this file)!  (v3.41)
		- Added the program's home directory to the path to search for the 
		  "myfonts" file.  (v3.42)
		- Provided better (more general) defaults for ".myefonts" and 
		  ".myethemes".
3.43 Fri Aug 6 2002
		- Added "shebang" option to the Perl option to find the Perl interpreter 
		  ("which perl") and add a "#!" line.  Cursor should be at (0,0).
4.13 Thu Jul 27 2006
		- Added -editor option to specify an alternate module to Tk::SuperText 
		  so that one can use Tk::CodeText and do syntax highlighting.
4.14 Thu Aug 31 2006
		- Fixed Split-screen to better keep proper size in both Windows & 
		  Linux.
4.40 Mon Sep 3 2007
		- Numerous minor enhancements, fixed disappearing text cursor pbm. 
		  when palette theme changed from a dark to a light color.
		- Switched from CodeText to TextHighlight as the highlighting 
		  text widget of choice.
4.42 Mon Sep 17 2007
		- Minor fixes to make the AfterStep window-manager raise and give 
		  focus to the proper window whenever a popup window is closed. 
		  This only affects AfterStep when used in "ClickToFocus" mode.
5.00	Wed Oct 15 2008
		- Added multi-tab browsing via Tk::Notebook.  Rewrote bookmarks to 
		  now have separate set of bookmarks for each tab and each split 
		  screen within a tab.  Added -nobrowsetabs option to not use 
		  tabbed-browsing (old, single screen way).  Fixed several small 
		  bugs, binds, and optimizations.
5.10 Mon Oct 27 2008
		- Fix Windows compatability issues and release new self-installing 
		  binary.
5.12 Tue Oct 28 2008
		- Fix auto-indent bug introduced in last version.
5.13 Thu Oct 30 2008
		- Fix very minor issues on Windows.
5.25 Fri Jun 25 2010
		- Cause files to be opened with cursor at "_bookmark", if set.
5.26 Fri Jun 25 2010
		- Fix bug that caused "Re-Highlight" menu items to be duplicated.
5.31 Sat Aug 7 2010
		- Numerous minor tweaks and bugfixes.  Added 0 and 'END' to list 
		  of marks to goto using the "Highlight Goto" dropdown list.  
		  One can also type in a line#.
5.43 Tue Oct 5 2012
		- Fixed Backup-On-Destroy to save files in all tabs - was erronously 
		  saving only the file in right-most tab in the backups for all tabs.
5.61		- Fix bug in selection of default startup directory / finding .ini 
		  configuration file.
5.71		- Add special code to mitigate keyboard-focusing issues due to a bug 
		  specific to the Afterstep windowmanager and popup windows.
5.8		- Combine the button row with the top menu to provide more 
		  edit-screen space, correct padding of new buttons to look like the 
		  existing menubuttons, and add "mb" option to allow separate button 
		  bar to be displayed the old way (-mb=2 for 2 rows).
5.81		- Fix bug that caused "Append" button to overwrite file instead.
5.91 Wed Feb 3 2016
		- Numerous cleanups and tweaks to release as a Windows install
		  executable.
5.92 Wed Feb 24 2016
		- Make e read from stdin if "-" given as a file name.
5.95 Thu Feb 16 2017
		- Make Edit.Show Filename past full file name to PRIMARY selection.
		- Added File.Open in Tab menu option to open filename(s) highlighted 
		  in PRIMARY selection, great for opening additional files selected 
		  in JFM4 an existing instance.
5.96 -NOT RELEASED-
		- Work around fix for bug that hung system in memory-gobbling loop 
		  if [Control-[Tab]] pressed in the text box when Text::SuperText 
		  or TextHighlight editing widgets used due to a bug in 
		  Text::SuperText.
5.97 -NOT RELEASED-
		- Fixed issue of bookmarks not being saved on normal save and exit.
		- Fixed issue with the drop-down list in the "Goto" popup window 
		  that caused the field to be filled with "0.0" instead of empty and 
		  instead of going to the selected bookmark button location, ie. 
		  "Back", "Insert", etc. instead jumped to the top of the file and 
		  highlighted all the text inbetween.
5.98
		- Fixed "Home Directory" issue in M$-Windows that prevented themes, 
		  etc. from working properly.
		- Make all menubuttons take focus and be included in the focus-loop.
		- Bind the [Alt-[<]] and [Alt-[>]] keys to the Search next backwards 
		and Search next forward functions of the corresponding menubuttons.
		- Bind [Control-[Tab]] key to jump between the top and bottom 
		sessons when editing screen is "split".
		- Clean up the other [Tab]-key sequence bindings to work better.
		- Clean up and greatly improve functionality of the "auto-save" 
		features.  NOTE "auto-save" does NOT save on a periodic bases like 
		many commercial-grade wordprocessors, but rather makes "backup" 
		copy files with unique names in the "/tmp" directory when opening 
		a file or closing without saving, or when the user selects "[File]
		.[Back up /tmp *] options to save snapshots.
5.99		- Add little button to fill the wasted space in the lower right 
		corner by the scrollbars:  that jumps to position 0.0 ("home").
6.00		- Append .cdout directory to unpathed filenames when opening, if 
		it exists.
6.10		- Fixed minor issues with dual-screen (screen-splitting) option.
		- Fixed minor issues with AfterStep window-manager quirks code.
		- Added POD documentation and manpage.
6.11		- Fixed minor font-selection issue.
		- Moved default program config. files from bin/ to share/E
		- Fix expand-icon squares for XMLViewer to have white background 
		when using "night" backgrounds.
		- Deactivate old "Afterstep" windowmanager hacks since we fixed 
		Afterstep!
		- Add POD docs (to bottom of source file).
		- Misc. code cleanups.
6.12		- Fix bug causing wrong background color to sometimes be used in tags.
		- Don't do search/replace if no search string specified.
		- Don't say "found/changed" if no replacement string specified 
		in searches.
6.13		- Don't popup "Save Changes" dialog when opening a new file, if 
		no changes made in the current file.
6.14		- Add "Reverse" Edit menu option to reverse the characters in the 
		highlighted string.
6.15		- Remove unnecessary (redundant) Alt-v (Paste Primary) in popup 
		windows' text fields.
6.17		- Fix not using current-working directory when $ENV{HOME} not set bug.
		- Make sure we have Tk::Notebook installed when using -tabs.
6.18		- Clean up menu-code a bit.
		- Recognize Xresource and Xdefaults files as "Xresources" for syntax 
		highlighting (Kate) even though they lack extensions.
6.19		- Fix off-by-one character conversion of selected text when changing 
		case with the Upper-case and Lower-case Edit menu functions.
		- Add Chr2Hex and Hex2Chr Edit menu functions.
6.20		- Add a Regex-search option to Searches in order to search for escaped 
		regex strings in Perl code.
		- Combine and clean up some of the Edit menu conversion functions.
6.21		- Add Time option to Edit menu for highlighting Perl Time values and 
		displaying the time value in human-readable format.
6.22		- Settle on how Alt-Tab binding/focus should work and fix up.
6.23		- Fix off-by-one character in Search function if search string 
		ends in a newline character.  This primarily enables deleting entire 
		lines that contain the search string (specified as a regular exp.)
6.25		- Add "Unescape u00##" Edit menu function for converting "\u00##" 
		- low-order ASCII characters to their 8-bit ASCII character equivalent.
		- Try harder to detect if changes have actually been made to a file 
		before popping up a dialog asking user if he's sure he wants to save 
		changes before exiting.
6.26		- Dont treat a search string containing only spacing characters (that 
		match "\s" in Perl as an empty search string, ie. case where one 
		wishes to match say a tab key ("\t" and change it to say 8 spaces.
6.27		- Fix failure (by Perl/Tk?) to tell the window-manager to treat popup 
		dialog boxes as "transient" (ie. to ensure they stay on top of the 
		main window when main window is focused / raised.
6.28		- Make Themes menu popup to right of menubar to avoid covering it, 
		since it's user-editable, and mine, at least, contains enough theme 
		entries to make it nearly span the screen vertically.
		- Pack the buttons and menubuttons on the menubar slightly thinner 
		(to save screen realestate) and more consistant in appearance. 
		(Perl/Tk seems to require slightly different padding for standalone 
		buttons vs the "menubuttons" that invoke dropdown menus and the top 
		menubar contains a mixture of both.
6.29		- Properly convert filenames beginning with "~/" to $ENV{HOME}/".
		- Also make our setPalette.pl function optional (failed to start 
		without it).
6.31		- Treat clipboard containing only "space" characters (that match "\s" 
		in Perl) as if clipboard was empty when starting up.
		- Theme the Notebook (tabs) widget more like GTK-3ish tab widgets for 
		a prettier (imho) and more consistant desktop appearance with other 
		apps.  To retain the "classic" Perl/Tk-ish" look, set "classictabs=1" 
		on command-line or in .ini file(s).
6.32		- Fix failure to show "--SELECTED TEXT--" in the title-bar if opening 
		with text in the clipboard (where normally the filename of the file 
		opened).  Previously was just showing "".
6.33		- not released
6.34		- Make "Open" ribbon button (now "Open+") open in new tab (if using 
		tabs.  This makes it easy to select/highlight a file and press a 
		single button without having to go into the File menu.
		- Allow a position (line#[.col#] to be appended (preceeded by a colon) 
		to a file-name to cause the file to be opened prepositioned there.
6.35		23/01/05
		- Add new [+Tab] button for opening a file in a new tab (was [Open+], 
		but that button renamed to [Open] and restored to it's originial 
		function.
		- Remove [Exit] ([Save]+[Quit]) button to reduce clutter (redundant).
6.36    -NOT RELEASED-
		- Add some old PC-Write(tm) key bindings I used back in the day, 
		namely Shift-Insert (Insert blank line), Shift-Delete (Delete current 
		line), Ctrl-BackSpace (Delete word left), Ctrl-Delete (Delete word 
		right), Alt-BackSpace (Delete to start of line), and Alt-Delete 
		(Delete to end of line.
6.40    -NOT RELEASED-
		- Add & fix some SuperText bindings for consistancy w/SuperText when 
		not using SuperText, and make work with latest TextHighlight v2+.  
		- Fix potential infinite loop situation in global searches due to 
		slight inconsistancies in the way different Text* widgets handle the 
		cursor and select tagging.
		- Fix minor issue with imwheel bindings.
6.41    -NOT RELEASED-
		- Add Tk::TextHighlight v2's new "-smartindent" feature to also make 
		available when not using Tk::TextHighlight v2+.
		- Fix inability to load data properly when changing to a different 
		file in v (readonly version) due to Tk::TextHighlight v2+'s stricter 
		enforcement of readonly mode.
		- Fix apparantly long-standing bug that caused numeric (line-
		positioning) bookmarks to fail (we now automatically prepend the 
		string "posn" to such numeric marks.
6.42    -NOT RELEASED-
		- Fix some Tk::TextANSIColor support issues.
		- Treat files with the ".cc" extension as C-ish files ("use C" menu 
		option).
		- Improve the "smartindent" feature copied from Tk::TextHighlight v2.
		- Slightly improve rehighlighting speed during searches.
		- Fix bug in the Perl.Highlight Fns menu option that inserted a copy 
		of the found function name next to the highlighted function when using 
		v (READONLY) mode (must NOT do that)!
v6.43   24/07/16
		- (Includes all changes made to the "NOT RELEASED" development vsns.)
		- Fix wheelmouse bindings to not try to require BindMouseWheel.pl if 
		using Tk::Text::SuperText v1.2+ as this is no longer necessary.  
		Also apply BindMouseWheel (if still needed) to the bottom pane if 
		split-window.
		- Do not error if BindMouseWheel.pl is requested but not installed.
		- Do not require Text::Tabs module anymore as it is not used.
		- Fix failure of the "-s='search string'" to find and place the cursor 
		when starting up if the "_Bookmark" was set at a position after the 
		last occurrance of the "search string".  Also allow post-pending 
		"/i" to the search string to search case-insensitively.  
		Note:  currently full regex expressions are not permitted in the "-s" 
		option.
		- Touch up the Error/Warning/Are You Sure dialogs a bit.
		- Stop removing the selection tag when doing a global search (when 
		search limited to a selected area).
		- Fix inconsistancies in some theme-change situations, and support 
		additional color parameters in .myethemes (besides the basic "$c" 
		(palette), $bg & $fg (text areas)).  Examples are "$background", 
		"$foreground" (non-text area bg & fg), $insertBackground (cursor 
		color), etc. supported by Tk::setPalette.  Also make sure palette 
		changes are applied to the (Tk::Notebook) tabs' appearance.
		Note:  one will often need to apply theme changes to each tab and 
		both top and bottom text widgets (a bug that can also be viewed as a 
		feature!
		- Make sure all the additional language-specific menu items that can 
		alter the text are all greyed out when using v (readonly) version!
		- Update copyright year to 2024.
		- Fix the C.Check (syntax), which was not working at all.
		- Make the Perl.shabang menu option first check for the existance of 
		/usr/bin/perl & use that before going with "which perl".  This to 
		address the common situation of having a symlink from 
		/usr/local/bin/perl to /usr/bin/perl but normally wanting to use 
		/usr/bin/perl in programs being created for public release, as the 
		latter IS the normal expected location of Perl on most machines.
		- JCutCopyPaste.pl - Fix minor issues with selecting proper cut buffer.
		- BindMouseWheel.pl - Removed obsolete main-window bindings that 
		assume the main window is always named "$MainWin".
6.44		24/07/26
		- Add corresponding "View This" in the Edit menu for the editor state 
		(The viewer state has the mirror of this labeled "Edit This").  This 
		will open a Viewer window of the file in the tab being edited in it's 
		previously-saved state.
6.45		24/08/01
		- Fix failure to group together delete/insert combinations into a 
		single Undo step when undoing changes.  Examples of these are search/
		replace operations, block commenting, construct block insertions, etc.
		- Fix bug that prevented searching backwards in some regex-based 
		search strings including Perl's Highlight Functins menu option.
		- Fix the "d-bug" search/replace button's and the "Perl" menu's 
		"Highlight Functions" option's language-specific aspects.
6.46		24/08/10
		- Fix global search/replace failure (only does 1st one) if search 
		pattern is a regular expression string that is shorter than the 
		string it matches.
6.47		24/08/22
		- Add support for new Tk::JFileDialog v2.40+ "-PreserveSelection" 
		feature (if using that version or higher).
		- Remove some dead / depreciated / unused code.
6.48		-NOT RELEASED-
6.49		24/12/14
		- The [Paste] button in the Search dialog should first attempt to 
		paste the PRIMARY selection, then fall back to CLIPBOARD content if 
		no PRIMARY selection (prev. was not always clearly defined & thus 
		not working consistantly).
		- (Revert) Do not set the new JFileDialog "-PreserveSelection", as it 
		does not work properly in context as used in E Editor.
6.5*		-NOT RELEASED-
6.60		25/02/25
		- Default $systmp (system temporary) directory to /tmp/ram if that 
		is a valid directory, otherwise to the previous default of /tmp.  This 
		is to allow for it to be a ramdisk, particularly for users who use an 
		SSD hard drive in order to reduce writes for very short-term temporary 
		files.  Also change the location of e.src.tmp (for test-compiling) and 
		e.out.tmp to use $systmp instead of $hometmp also for this reason.  
		- Fix window-resizing issues (bug) when splitting or unsplitting 
		editor screen.  This has been a long-standing bug that seemed to 
		manifest somewhat randomly, and always if user had previously adjusted 
		the size of the main window vertically.  This was extremely tricky and 
		difficult to fix due to inconsistancies in Perl/Tk's handling of 
		window geometry, expecially involving character/text based widgets, 
		and also vis-a-vis Perl/Tk's own geometry and packing documentation, 
		requiring much T&E.  Breakthrough ocurred when examining Jfm5's 
		(similar) splitScreen() code plus adding small amt. of code to cause 
		the initial window to come up sized for both panes even when started 
		with only a single file (pane)!
		- Fix another, apparently longstanding bug that often saved the file 
		from the wrong pane when combining a split-window (containing 2 
		separate files), by saving the file from the wrong window-pane (the 
		correct action is to save the file in the pane being closed, not the 
		active one, which remains open and expands to fill the closed pane's 
		window-area).
		- Eliminate certain redundant auto-backups to user's $hometmp 
		directory to reduce writes to potential SSD drives.
		- Numerous general code-cleanups and removal of long-commented out 
		(unused) code (accumulated cruft over the years).
6.61		25/03/13
		- Fix -debug to write e.dbg file to $systmp instead of hardcoded /tmp.
		- Fix failure to save unsaved changes on [Quit] right after performing 
		a successful compile test.
		- Fix failure to sometimes display file name of file being edited 
		instead of "--SELECTED TEXT--".
		- Correct BindMouseWheel.pl to use /usr/bin/perl.
6.62		25/03/17
		- Fix broken default backup on startup (when -nb option not used).
		Pbm. was that it was no longer backing up the opened file to 
		$hometmp/e.<nextbackup#>.tmp!
6.63		-NOT RELEASED-
		- Re-lookup/read .ini files for each tab/paine and file opened for the 
		(2 options for now:  "tabspacing" and "notabs") for changes based on 
		the path of the file being opened so that when editing source-files 
		for different projects (folders), one can be sure that source-code 
		edits will use the proper tab/spacing for that project (if that 
		project has it's own policy.
6.64		25/03/30
		- Fix failure to add files opened directly, via the "Open in New Tab" 
		& "[+Tab]" options are added to the file-dialog history (even though 
		this method bypasses the file-select dialog box.
		- Correct .ini file lookup order to fix some edge cases.
		- Minor code-cleanups.
		- Also includes v6.63 changes.
6.65		-NOT RELEASED-
		- Add -kandrstyle option to list of options that can be set in 
		different editing panes based in which .ini file applies to a given 
		file being edited/viewed (see also v6.63 changes above).
		- Tweak to make sure the -savemarks option is properly defaulted and 
		enforced.
6.66		25/05/08
		- Include all v6.65 (not released) changes.
		- Fix issues with how the "program's home directory" (fallback 
		location for seeking certain system-wide config. & .ini files - 
		should be either bin/ or share/E/ based on the ../bin/ directory the 
		program script resides in, ie. /usr/local/bin/e.pl: /usr/local/bin/ 
		and /usr/local/share/E/.
		- Fix more issues affecting .ini-file lookup when opening a file.
		- Prevent pasting the selection into the "Search For" dialog if it is 
		multiline!
		- Fix issues that sometimes caused global-searches to fail. 
		- Add "-nodialogselect" option (default 1/true) to prevent file-open 
		dialogs from clobbering the PRIMARY paste-buffer when selecting a file 
		to open (previously was clobbering it setting it to the full path of 
		the file one was opening.  Set to 0/false to keep old (latter) 
		behaviour, or manually select the file-name itself just before opening.
		- Only look up file-extension mimetypes (which can determine which 
		language formatter) once & no longer search the current directory 
		for .myemimes config file (not sure why we were).
		- Some slight code-efficiency improvements.
		- Now use the underlying Text widget's editModified() method to 
		determine whether a file has been modified (whether to prompt for 
		saving changes) before quitting.  Previously used so holistic logic to 
		try to determine this, but this is more accurate.
		- Ensure that the language-specific submodules (e_*.pl) also apply 
		options that can (now) be set in different editing panes.
