Changes:

3.2	 Mon Sep 17 2001
		- Added Dynamic Font support - Now create a personal FONT file 
		  containing the fonts you wish to use as ".myefonts".  See example 
		  included with this distribution.  File-name overrideable with: 
		  -f=fontfile.
		- Added Print option to File menu for command to apply to selected 
		  text or entire file.  Last command is saved in file ".myeprint".
3.23	Fri Jan 11 2002
		- Added themes, (move myethemes to .myethemes, and edit to suit).
3.3	 Thu Mar 21 2002
		- Added "-font" option, if numeric - specifies font on lin# in .myefonts 
		  file; otherwise, specifies 1st word of a font name in .myefonts.
		- Added auto-backup capability based on a new file stored in the 
		  program's home directory called ".ebackups".  this file contains a 
		  single line with a number, ie. 10. specifying the number of backup 
		  files to save before overwriting existing ones in $HOME/tmp.  A 
		  backup file is created whenever a new file is opened and contains 
		  the contents of the just-opened file, and is named "e.##.tmp".
		- Fixed problems with ability to stop processes in "Perl.Run" option.
3.32 Tue Jul 2 2002
		- Added manual backup menu option.
		- Fixed Tk/MainLoop problem which caused cpu to be 100% utilized

3.42 Wed Jul 31 2002
		- Fixed Perl.Run option stuff I broke in v3.32.
		- Changed "/" to "\\" in several places when running under M$-Windows.
		- Now looks for ".ebackups" in user's home directory instead of the 
		  program's home directory (each user should have their own copy of 
		  this file)!  (v3.41)
		- Added the program's home directory to the path to search for the 
		  "myfonts" file.  (v3.42)
		- Provided better (more general) defaults for ".myefonts" and 
		  ".myethemes".
3.43 Fri Aug 6 2002
		- Added "shebang" option to the Perl option to find the Perl interpreter 
		  ("which perl") and add a "#!" line.  Cursor should be at (0,0).
4.13 Thu Jul 27 2006
		- Added -editor option to specify an alternate module to Tk::SuperText 
		  so that one can use Tk::CodeText and do syntax highlighting.

4.40 Mon Sep 3 2007

		  when palette theme changed from a dark to a light color.
		- Switched from CodeText to TextHighlight as the highlighting 
		  text widget of choice.
4.42 Mon Sep 17 2007
		- Minor fixes to make the AfterStep window-manager raise and give 
		  focus to the proper window whenever a popup window is closed. 
		  This only affects AfterStep when used in "ClickToFocus" mode.
5.00	Wed Oct 15 2008
		- Added multi-tab browsing via Tk::Notebook.  Rewrote bookmarks to 
		  now have separate set of bookmarks for each tab and each split 
		  screen within a tab.  Added -nobrowsetabs option to not use 
		  tabbed-browsing (old, single screen way).  Fixed several small 
		  bugs, binds, and optimizations.

5.26 Fri Jun 25 2010
		- Fix bug that caused "Re-Highlight" menu items to be duplicated.
5.31 Sat Aug 7 2010

		  of marks to goto using the "Highlight Goto" dropdown list.  
		  One can also type in a line#.
5.43 Tue Oct 5 2012
		- Fixed Backup-On-Destroy to save files in all tabs - was erronously

		  edit-screen space, correct padding of new buttons to look like the 
		  existing menubuttons, and add "mb" option to allow separate button 
		  bar to be displayed the old way (-mb=2 for 2 rows).
5.81		- Fix bug that caused "Append" button to overwrite file instead.

		- Work around fix for bug that hung system in memory-gobbling loop 
		  if [Control-[Tab]] pressed in the text box when Text::SuperText 
		  or TextHighlight editing widgets used due to a bug in 
		  Text::SuperText.
5.97 -NOT RELEASED-
		- Fixed issue of bookmarks not being saved on normal save and exit.
		- Fixed issue with the drop-down list in the "Goto" popup window 
		  that caused the field to be filled with "0.0" instead of empty and 
		  instead of going to the selected bookmark button location, ie. 
		  "Back", "Insert", etc. instead jumped to the top of the file and 
		  highlighted all the text inbetween.
5.98
		- Fixed "Home Directory" issue in M$-Windows that prevented themes, 
		  etc. from working properly.
		- Make all menubuttons take focus and be included in the focus-loop.

		and Search next forward functions of the corresponding menubuttons.
		- Bind [Control-[Tab]] key to jump between the top and bottom 
		sessons when editing screen is "split".
		- Clean up the other [Tab]-key sequence bindings to work better.
		- Clean up and greatly improve functionality of the "auto-save" 
		features.  NOTE "auto-save" does NOT save on a periodic bases like 
		many commercial-grade wordprocessors, but rather makes "backup" 
		copy files with unique names in the "/tmp" directory when opening 
		a file or closing without saving, or when the user selects "[File]
		.[Back up /tmp *] options to save snapshots.
5.99		- Add little button to full the wasted space in the lower right

6.11		- Fixed minor font-selection issue.
		- Moved default program config. files from bin/ to share/E
		- Fix expand-icon squares for XMLViewer to have white background 
		when using "night" backgrounds.
		- Deactivate old "Afterstep" windowmanager hacks since we fixed 
		Afterstep!
		- Add POD docs (to bottom of source file).
		- Misc. code cleanups.
6.12		- Fix bug causing wrong background color to sometimes be used in tags.
		- Don't do search/replace if no search string specified.
		- Don't say "found/changed" if no replacement string specified 
		in searches.
6.13		- Don't popup "Save Changes" dialog when opening a new file, if 
		no changes made in the current file.
6.14		- Add "Reverse" Edit menu option to reverse the characters in the 
		highlighted string.
6.15		- Remove unnecessary (redundant) Alt-v (Paste Primary) in popup 
		windows' text fields.
6.17		- Fix not using current-working directory when $ENV{HOME} not set bug.
		- Make sure we have Tk::Notebook installed when using -tabs.
6.18		- Clean up menu-code a bit.
		- Recognize Xresource and Xdefaults files as "Xresources" for syntax 
		highlighting (Kate) even though they lack extensions.
6.19		- Fix off-by-one character conversion of selected text when changing 
		case with the Upper-case and Lower-case Edit menu functions.
		- Add Chr2Hex and Hex2Chr Edit menu functions.
6.20		- Add a Regex-search option to Searches in order to search for escaped 
		regex strings in Perl code.
		- Combine and clean up some of the Edit menu conversion functions.
6.21		- Add Time option to Edit menu for highlighting Perl Time values and 
		displaying the time value in human-readable format.
6.22		- Settle on how Alt-Tab binding/focus should work and fix up.
6.23		- Fix off-by-one character in Search function if search string 
		ends in a newline character.  This primarily enables deleting entire 
		lines that contain the search string (specified as a regular exp.)
6.25		- Add "Unescape u00##" Edit menu function for converting "\u00##" 
		- low-order ASCII characters to their 8-bit ASCII character equivalent.
		- Try harder to detect if changes have actually been made to a file 
		before popping up a dialog asking user if he's sure he wants to save 
		changes before exiting.
6.26		- Dont treat a search string containing only spacing characters (that 
		match "\s" in Perl as an empty search string, ie. case where one 
		wishes to match say a tab key ("\t" and change it to say 8 spaces.
6.27		- Fix failure (by Perl/Tk?) to tell the window-manager to treat popup 
		dialog boxes as "transient" (ie. to ensure they stay on top of the 
		main window when main window is focused / raised.
6.28		- Make Themes menu popup to right of menubar to avoid covering it, 
		since it's user-editable, and mine, at least, contains enough theme 
		entries to make it nearly span the screen vertically.
		- Pack the buttons and menubuttons on the menubar slightly thinner 
		(to save screen realestate) and more consistant in appearance. 
		(Perl/Tk seems to require slightly different padding for standalone 
		buttons vs the "menubuttons" that invoke dropdown menus and the top 
		menubar contains a mixture of both.
6.29		- Properly convert filenames beginning with "~/" to $ENV{HOME}/".
		- Also make our setPalette.pl function optional (failed to start 
		without it).
6.31		- Treat clipboard containing only "space" characters (that match "\s" 
		in Perl) as if clipboard was empty when starting up.
		- Theme the Notebook (tabs) widget more like GTK-3ish tab widgets for 
		a prettier (imho) and more consistant desktop appearance with other 
		apps.  To retain the "classic" Perl/Tk-ish" look, set "classictabs=1" 
		on command-line or in .ini file(s).
6.32		- Fix failure to show "--SELECTED TEXT--" in the title-bar if opening 
		with text in the clipboard (where normally the filename of the file 
		opened).  Previously was just showing "".
