INSTALLATION

To install, simply copy the file "e.pl" to somewhere in your executable PATH, 
ie. "/usr/local/bin/" and give users read & execute permissions on it.
Then create a symlink in the same directory to it named "v.pl".  Copy the 3 
files starting with "e_*.pl" and the other ".pl" files to one of your Perl 
library directories ie. "/usr/local/lib/site_perl/".  To determine this, do 
a "perl -V".  

You will also need to copy the files "myefonts", "myethemes", and "ebackups" 
to your home directory, edit them with e.pl or another text editor to fit 
your desires, then RENAME THEM such that they have the same names but with a 
leading dot ("."), ie. ".myefonts".

NOTE:  This program requires the following modules:  File::Copy, 
Tk (obviously), Tk::JDialog, Tk::JFileDialog, Tk::JOptionmenu, 
Tk::Adjuster, and Text::Tabs.  It can optionally make use of: 
File::Glob, Tk::TextHighlight (Code text highlighting), Tk::Text::SuperText 
(Bracket matching, numerous other cool features) Tk::Autoscroll, 
Tk::TextANSIColor (Color "Tags"), Tk::XMLViewer (Viewing XML files as a tree), 
Syntax::Highlight::Perl (required by Tk::TextHighlight), 
Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved (usable by Tk::TextHighlight), 
and Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate (usable by Tk::TextHighlight), 
though none of these modules are required unless you wish to use their 
features. 

If you do not want the program to make automatic backups when opening a new 
file, simply delete ".ebackups" from your home directory.  The default is to 
keep the last 20 backups, to change this, edit this file and change the 1st 
number (from 19 to 1 less than desired number).  Create a "tmp" subdirectory 
under your home directory.  Backups will be created there in sequence as 
"e.#.tmp" where "#" is a number between 0 and the number of backups you set 
up.  After # exceeds that number, it cycles back to zero (e.0.tmp).

This script needs Perl, and Tk.  The Perl/Tk module:  "Text::SuperText", 
available on CPAN, is NO LONGER REQUIRED, but adds bracket-matching!  
"e.pl" also works on Windows and can be compiled with "perl2exe" or PAR, 
but I can't post the binary, since I have not purchased a registered copy 
of (commercial) perl2exe :-(.  Also note, compiling within the editor does not 
seem to work in the Windows 95/98 version and I haven't figured out why.  
It has to do with shelling out.  If anyone can figure this out (e_pl.pl), 
please send me a patch!  It seems to work fine in Windows-NT/XP, though.  
You may also want my "setPalette" module, if you are setting the palette color 
to a dark value, ie.:  "e.pl -c=darkblue edit_file.txt &".

To create a view-only version of the editor, symlink "v.pl" to "e.pl".
Invoke as "e.pl [-options] file" or "v.pl [-options] file".

Note:  The following options may also be specified one per line, or in 
configuration files named after the corresponding executable, ie. e.ini, v.ini, 
ec.ini, vc.ini, etc.) without the preceeding "-".  

This configuration file will be searched for 1st in the current working 
directory, then the parent directory up to root (/), then the program 
directory.  Note:  It does NOT look in the home directory unless the current 
working directory is at or below the home directory though!

Options:

	e.pl -c=color		(set palette)
	-editor=module  (default TextUndo).  Tk Text-widget-based module 
		to use.  Known to work:  Text, TextUndo, SuperText, 
		TextANSIColor, and TextHighlight.
	-viewer=module  (v.pl)  (default ROText).  Same as for -editor, but 
		applies to v.pl (viewer-mode).  Should be based on ROText.  
		Known to work:  ROText, ROTextANSIColor, ROSuperText, 
		ROTextHighlight, and XMLViewer.
	-codetext=[Kate::]Language   Used with -[editor|viewer]=*TextHighlight
		Selects which language highlighter to use with TextHighlight /
		ROTextHighlight.  Default is based on file-extension or "Perl".
	-theme=<themename>  No default - Name of color theme to start up in - 
		For list of themes, view/edit ~/.myethemes  If -fg or -bg are 
		also specified, they override for the text widget whatever 
		colors are specified in ~/.myethemes for <themename>.  
		Format of text file (each line):  
			Themename:$c="color"|""|DEFAULT; $fg="color"|same; $bg="color|same"
			"color" can be a color-name or "#rrggbb".
			See myethemes (file included) for examples.
	-palette=<palette> - Default (.Xdefaults: tkPalette)  (tkVPalette 
		for viewer (v.pl)).  Overridden by -theme option, if specified.
	-fg=foreground,
	-bg=background   (change foreground and background)
		(default:  -fg=green -bg=black)
		(You can use these also with -c)
	-nb  (editor only) - causes the file not to be auto-backed up when 
		opened.
	-l=line#[.col#]	(start with cursor on that line# / column#)
		NOTE:  Lines#s are one-based, but column#s are zero-based!!!
		Default (1.0)
	-s="str"		(start with cursor on 1st match of "str").
	-f=</path/to/fontfile>  Default:  ./.myefonts|~/.myefonts
		|<programhome>/myefonts;   Text file containing list of font
		definitions to use in the font-selection dialog.

			IndexCharacter Description:unix-font-string
			Example:  A Normal-17 LT:-*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-17-*-100-100-*-*-*-*
			Select this font with "-font=A" or to make default, make 
			this the first line in the "~/.myefonts" file.
			See myefonts (file included) for examples.
	-font=#|id|unix-font-string:  Specify the index# or id (in font file) 
		or the Unix font string to use as the default text font.
		Default 0 (1st font in font-file).

		small font, large font, or huge font - 
		default is small font).

	-height=#		Specify # lines to show at start (default 25).
	-kandrstyle=0|1|2   Specify K&R-style Perl stmts. when inserting 
		into code. 0: "if ()\n{"; 1: "if (){"; 2: "if () {".
	-notabs=0|1  Pad indentations with 0=tabs; 1=spaces
	-classictabs=0|1  If specified and == 1, use classic Perl/Tk styling 
		for Tk::Notebook (tabs) widget, otherwise use more modern GTK-3 
		tab widget colors.
	-tabspacing=#   Number of spaces equivalent to a tab when indenting.
		Default 3.
	-savemarks=0|1  1=Save bookmark locations automatically when file is

	-homedir=<path>  Default $HOME (~/).  User's "HOME" directory for 
		looking for configuration files, such as ".myefonts", 
		".myethemes",	etc.

TEXT-HIGHLIGHTING AND INI OPTIONS FILES:

You can also specify options in an "ini" file, (e.ini and/or v.ini).  
For example, I use TextHighlight when editing Perl code, so I set up a 
file (ec.ini) containing:

editor=TextHighlight

and did:

	ln -s e.pl ec.pl

This allows me to do "ec.pl file.pl" for syntax-highlighting!

To use the syntax highlighting, first go to CPAN and install 
Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved and Tk::TextHighlight.  Then either create 
an e.ini file or specify the command-line options:

e.pl -editor=TextHighlight [-codetext=Perl] myfile.pl
	-or-
v.pl -viewer=ROTextHighlight [-codetext=Perl] myfile.pl


Enjoy the Ride! ;-)
