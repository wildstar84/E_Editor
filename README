SYNOPSIS
            <e.pl> [I<-options>] [file1 [-tabs file2 file3 ...]]

            <e.pl> [I<-options>] file1 file2  #FOR SPLIT-SCREEN EDITING

            <v.pl> [I<-options>] [file1 [-tabs file2 file3 ...]]  #VIEWING

DESCRIPTION
    E Editor provides a convenient screen text editor for editing text files
    and source-code files, etc. E features language-based color-syntax
    highlighting, bracket-matching and jumping, and syntax-checking for Perl
    and C sources, quick-eval and quick-run for Perl sources. General
    features include multiple browser tabs and split-screen option for
    editing multiple files at once. Named bookmarks, easy search and
    replace, easy auto and manual file backup, and recent file and
    search-term memory, and an open-readonly option. Depending on what's
    available on your system, E can use any one of a number of installed
    Tk::Text-derived widgets for it's editing screen, for example,
    Tk::TextHighlight, Tk::Text::SuperText, Tk::TextUndo, etc. To use E
    Editor as a (readonly) viewer, simply symlink "v.pl" to "e.pl". Drag and
    Drop files is available for M$-Windows users.

        (viewer-mode). Should be based on Tk::ROText. The "Tk::" is omitted.

        *ROTextHighlight*, and *XMLViewer*. Default: *ROText*.

    You can also specify the above options in an "ini" file, (e.ini for
    editor mode and v.ini for viewer mode).

    Example, I use TextHighlight when editing code, so symlinked ec.pl to
    e.pl for highlighted code-editing, and set up a file (ec.ini)
    containing:

                    editor=TextHighlight

RESOURCES
    tktextcutchars
        List of "cut-characters" used by Tk.

    tkPalette
        Default palette color for this and some other Perl/Tk applications.

    tkVpalette
        Default palette color for the "viewer" (v.pl) version of this
        program.

FILES
    e.pl
        Main program script source.

    v.pl
        Symlink to e.pl which, when run, is readonly.

    ~/.ebackups
        Data file that specifies the maximum number of backup files to keep
        and the number of the latest backup file index number. Single line
        of text in the format:

        *max-number-of-backups-to-keep*,*last-backup-file-number*

    ~/.myefonts (or *program-home*/myefonts
        Font configuration file (for list of fonts available in the [Fonts]
        dropdown menu).

    ~/.myehist
        Program-created "history" list of last several files opened.

    ~/.myemimes (or *program-home*/myemimes
        User-created mime-configuration text file for syntax-highlighting
        special cases. Line Format: *file-extension*:*[Kate::]Language*

        Example1: mod:Kate::Modula-2 Example2: tmpl:HTML

        See -codetext option.

    ~/.myepaths
        List of favorite directories with optional descriptive names for use
        in the file-open dialog. Optional, user-created.

    ~/.myeprint
        Program-created data file containing printer command last used by
        the [File].[Print] dialog.

    ~/.myeprofiles
        Optional user-created file listing directories for which an
        alternate directory should be searched for an e.ini configuration
        file. This is useful for remote servers on which an e.ini file can
        or should not be stored.

        Line format:
        *directory-edited-file-is-in*:*directory-ini-file-is-in*

    ~/.myethemes (or *program-home*/myethemes
        Theme configuration file (for list of themes available in the
        [Themes] dropdown menu).

    ./*program-name*.ini
        Optional user-created text configuration file for specifying default
        options for *program-name*.pl. Normally *program-name* will be
        *"e"*. A separate one should be used for the viewer symlink (*"v"*.
        It may be desirable to create other symlink names in order to use
        other corresponding *.ini files. The program searches for these .ini
        files in the order: 1) The directory the file being edited, 2) The
        directory pointed to by ~/.myeprofiles, if the directory the file
        being edited in is in that list, 3) The user's home directory
        (*~/*), and last, the directory the program script is in, (often
        /usr/local/share/E/, if the program lives in /usr/local/bin/). The
        search stops when one is found.

    ./*filename*.emk
        Program-created file containing bookmark indices and tag data
        created in the same directory (if possible) of the *filename* being
        edited and saved.

    ~/tmp/e.*index-number*.tmp
        Program-created file for backup copies of file being edited.
        *index-number* is a sequence number derived from the "rolodex"
        maintained by ~/.ebackups.

    /tmp/e_*type-letter*Tab*tab#*W*window#*_*filename*_<random-number>.tmp
        Auto-backup and manual temporary backup files from the
        [File].[Backup /tmp] menu options. *type-letter* is either "B" -
        auto open backup, "U" - user-requested temp. backup from menu, or
        "X" - auto exit backup.
